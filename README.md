# Prototype-Mini

This is a quick-start template for setting up a **FastAPI** microservice with **OpenAI integration**. Perfect for building lightweight API prototypes where a UI isn't needed initially. The project is containerized with Docker for easy setup and deployment.

> **Prototype-Mini** is the lightweight FastAPI version of [Prototype](https://github.com/vorniches/prototype). Use **Prototype** for full-stack Django projects with UI, and **Prototype-Mini** for fast API-only microservices.

## Requirements
